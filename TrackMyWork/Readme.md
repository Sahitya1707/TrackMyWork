# What is this application about?
- Let me write about it at the last. :). So this application is about tracking everything for a person who does a freelance kind of work, including invoice, clients, projects, timesheets. But rightnow due to the limited availability of time.
- As of now, you will be able to the crud operation with project and client and you can also send the message to the specific clients and clients should be using the same email to see about their project details and message. You cannot update & delete the message as I think it shouldnot be changed.
