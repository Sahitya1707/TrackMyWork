# What is this application about?
- Let me write about it at the last. :). So this application is about tracking everything for a person who does a freelance kind of work, including invoice, clients, projects, timesheets. But rightnow due to the limited availability of time, I am only able to show case small feature of adding, reading, update and deleting of client and project section. Other things are still in the build phase.
